# MSU_USB_STOR
### Description:
The following storage is the basis of coding development and planning. The following code allows a USB device to be activated under password protection, and records the progress development of the developments of Dr. Elizabeth Johnson. The coding and software development was formed in the cooperation of Dr. Johnson and Undergraduate Jace L. Zavarelli. Any of the following information and details will be focused on the developments of the whole research/ project. 

## Research
The coding language used in the following research will be the Java language. The code will be created on the visual studio code development environment. The software being developed will use a list of API's, and the development will be connected to government clearance. 

## Code Development
The code is formatted with a base heirarchy that consist of a frame interfacing module. The other classes serve as launching mechanism for the USB software system.
